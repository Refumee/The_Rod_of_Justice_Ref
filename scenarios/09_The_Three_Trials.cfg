            story= _ "As we vanquished the final enemy, Vikren did not appear. Rather, a strange mist began to seep in through the cave walls, and we all began to feel deeply weary. Soldiers dropped to the floor, asleep. The glow in the eyes of skeletons faded, and they fell to the ground in heaps of bones and dark sinew."

        [part]
            story= _ "Our loyal followers grouped around us, fearing an attack, waiting as the mist grew closer. Even now, I myself find it hard to keep my eyes open. The spectral glow from Mal Idyr's skull is flickering. Adria is trying to fight it off with incantations and spells, but we grow even more tired with each passing moment."

        [part]
            story= _ "Fighting alongside them, I would like to believe that I can call both Mal Idyr and Adria friends now. Perhaps we are a bit short with one another at times, but... I cannot believe that either of them would have agreed to journey so far if they truly resented the other so. If Vikren has tricked us, and this is where we meet our ends... Then I think that this is not such bad company to die in."

The Convocation, ever holding out hope, never received the artifact it had so hoped for. New Elensia was overrun and razed to the ground, the millenium-old marble statues of Elynia-Thanadria and Parandra destroyed. Erya never did receive the Rod of Justice, but after defeating the members of The Convocation and absorbing their powers, she was more than happy with her strength. Amurlai fell soon after, though Raelyan did escape to the north with her people. Her warnings fell on the deaf ears of skeptical officers and she never received a meeting with the leaders of Adavyan's descendants. She eked out a melancholy existence as the baroness of a small castle situated in the wilderness of the north, watching as chaos continued to eat away at the continent..."

She did not want mermen anywhere nearby; Ega had always held a particular grudge against them for Lord Typhon's assistance in killing the Morogor drakes and for the Jotha mermen's murder of the Bilheld ones.

Erya never did receive the Rod of Justice, and the Soul Jewel became lost beneath the volcano, but after defeating the members of The Convocation and absorbing their powers, she was more than happy with her strength. Amurlai fell soon after, though Raelyan did escape to the north with her people, where her warnings fell on the deaf ears of skeptical Aragwaithi.
