Personally responsible for the death of both Lord Aetheodd Esari, one of Parandel's most skilled spearmen, and Archmistress Meiara, the nation's top elementalist, Demon Lord Erya is a fearsome scourge of a warrior. Her ghoulish ability to assimilate and acquire the powers of her enemies after she's slain them seems to be an anomaly. Whether it is genetic, magical, or otherwise is unknown - but it means that her strength can only multiply after every battle, and she has used it to stockpile her abilities so that there are few who can rival her. She can rend her enemies asunder with her battleaxe blade and pierce them with its speared point, or freeze them still from afar with her chilled curses. Her utter mastery of elemental and ethereal magics allows her to control and reshape the very landscape on which she battles. This will be your hardest battle yet, brave hero. The fate of the entire country and countless lives now rests in your hands. Preserve them."

Intent that either she acquires the Rod, or it is lost to Irdya forever, Erya has used her enormous magic reserves and her stolen elemental prowess to cause volcanic eruptions in the mountain ranges lining the valley. But such magical theatrics come at heavy cost to Erya, and she is burning through her stored power rapidly. The pressure is on, and the heat is rising, literally - but victory is in your sights. Good luck, brave hero. The battle's finale draws close."

Using stolen arts from Lady Meiara, Erya has transformed her living body into that of an elemental. Though this makes her unspeakably more powerful, the technique is also considered a suicidal last resort technique by most elementalists in Parandel - it is an irreversible spell that requires an obscene amount of magic and stamina to both cast and maintain. You will need to be exceedingly careful. This will be your final battle, brave hero - vanquish Erya, and finish this once and for all. Good luck."
