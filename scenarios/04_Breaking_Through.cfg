            story= _ "And so it was that we set out on our mission - myself, Adria, and Mal Idyr. My troops from the outpost were quite seasoned now, and we looked a formidable force with undead at our backs, which oddly enough did not make me uneasy. Some of the Aragwaithi among us still murmur in hushed, disapproving tones at the notion of marching with Mal Idyr - the writings of the Order of the Holy Flame do not approve of necromancers. But they tolerate him well enough, and I suppose that is all that I may ask of them for now."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Adria remains rather tight-lipped about her past. If she has discovered anything new since the meeting, I fear she will not share such information. Mal Idyr seems rather disgruntled as well, perhaps it has something to do with his brother or Lady Valgatha... From time to time he will eye me, as if he sees some imminent shadow huddled over me, and then turn away."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "It seems I cannot get them to trust me - any conversation I float by withers shortly thereafter. I do know we've only just met, but I'm not accustomed to such untenable silence. Even if the talk at the outpost was sometimes shallow - the weather, the scorpions, drawing shapes in the sand - it was better than whatever this standoffish tension is. Adria is friendly, no doubt, but remains constantly cautious. The men and women I have led from Ortraxz all place their faith in me, and yet it seems I cannot befriend a faerie and a lich - magical creatures are an interesting sort, surely. Chamilix provides reassurance that they will grow to respect me in time, and I find peace of mind by his counsel."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "I do not know what it is to hear a father's advice, but I'd imagine Chamilix's words are close to it. If nothing else, he and the other saurians are family and company enough, when the rest of our party maintains such an eerie quiet."
