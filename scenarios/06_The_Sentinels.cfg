            story= _ "Adria and Mal Idyr have been quiet ever since their little spat at Kemexsz. We get closer to the Rod every day, but the two of them never speak of it. Adria seems miffed at the least, but Mal Idyr... There is a deep and unresolved sorrow in his heart, that much I can read. I sense Vikren is somewhat of a tender subject for him."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "The two of them always insist on being so damned mysterious. I know that Adria remembers more than she's letting on, and while Mal Idyr certainly did make strides in being transparent, he's not telling us everything. But of course, why would I want to know everything?"
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "Though we've only been together for a short time, I still do feel a sort of kinship with them - a common bond. And yet I also feel as if I mustn't grow too attached to them... Three members of the Convocation are dead, and either of them could be next... For Parandel's sake and mine, we must end this soon. Erya has to be defeated. Only then can I enjoy safety again."

        [part]
            story= _ "All my worries aside, the journey itself is still harrowing. Our people have become more accustomed to living under the open suns over the years, but still it does not make them any less merciless. We treasure what little rest we can get, but thus far it has been a beleaguered shamble under burning skies. On quiet nights, though, when there is no sound but the crackling of the campfires' low embers and the cries of wolves ricocheting over the dunes and the slow lulls of wind tossing the sand, Mal Idyr will sometimes indulge us in more tales from the days of Wesnoth."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "It is a welcome distraction - to imagine what a kinder, though not wholly kind, world must've been like. Stories of great heroes like Li'sar and Konrad I overthrowing the wicked queen Asheviere, of the sorceress Niryone's battle against the dark sorcerer Mizenwyn, of the Lady of Light convincing Vikren I to incite revolution... Grand tales, all, and yet fascinating as they are, I feel sometimes that they can only remind us that we live in a world with a lush past yet no future. I do find comfort in the knowledge that Konrad I was younger than I am now when he fought for the throne, though. Tonight, however, Mal Idyr has returned to the tale of his days in Weldyn:"

Elantos suffered a fatal wound during the battle. And so with his dying breath, he transitioned from the realm of life to unlife, becoming the lich Mal N'tos. Travelling near the Estmarks he was ambushed by several paladins.'"

            story= _ "'But Tirasz wasn't a fool; when my brother said anything, Tirasz took it literally. First, my brother was to swear an oath of loyalty to Tirasz and his line, aiding the saurians in whatever manner they needed. Secondly, he was to reanimate all the fallen saurians on the battlefield and all those who would fall afterward, so that they would be forever surrounded in the battlefield glory. Lastly, Tirasz wanted Elantos to bind his soul to a crystal of his choosing when he died, so he may forever be present to lend power and wisdom to his descendants.'"

In exercise of his first promise, Tirasz led Elantos and the remaining saurians under his command to conquer the Bitter Swamp. The few undead lords there were either eradicated or fell under the joint command of Elantos and Tirasz. The saurian population already present was quickly conquered and Tirasz was crowned Grand Oracle.'"

            story= _ "'What my brother was soon to discover was that saurians reproduced quickly; they reached maturity by age three and generally didn't live past twenty at a generous maximum. And so as Wesnoth's jurisdiction expanded under my own watch, his armies swelled over the same time period.'"

What was worrisome in those days was the fervor brought on by the Guild of White Magi, who preached with a renewed force their beliefs in the Lords of Light. Freedom of thought and belief were outlined in the Wesnothian Drafts, what bothered me was their proximity to Vikren.'"

He instructed the Guild to not read it until his death.'"

Several members of the Council, generals, and nobles were tried for their illicit deeds: bribery, intimidation, assassination, perjury, murder, trial rigging, using magic to sway public opinion. Those who confessed were 'forgiven' if they agreed to support a candidate preselected by the Guild for rule of Wesnoth, whereas those who entertained the very laws they had helped create were tried with little hope of acquittal.'"
