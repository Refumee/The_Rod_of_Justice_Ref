Despite being the least powerful of the three Demon Lords who now attack Parandel, Demon Lord Alazarik possesses incredible shapeshifting abilities, a depthful understanding of arcane magic and hand to hand combat, as well as a mysterious gift of power from Erya that allows him to manipulate his surroundings and augment his magic. Fight carefully, brave hero. You'll need to make use of Valgatha's strengths and any units with ARCANE attacks to beat this powerful foe. Currently, he occupies the form of Loreimir, the Iron Lord."
