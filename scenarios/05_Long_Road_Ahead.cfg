            story= _ "I suppose it is due time I explain to you all how what occurred on the battlefield was possible. But behind that story, even, is another story. It all began, really, in 1738 YW: The year my half-brother Elantos was born within the Grey Woods."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "I was born six years later, but despite that we still shared much in common: an aptitude for magic, a profound sense of curiosity, and a love for the shadowy groves around us. The Grey Woods had been a holding of our house since the days of Helicrom, but the peace the mysterious green sheltered was not to last. When we were still young, our father was killed in an attempt to gain power over our lands. My mother, one of the few survivors of the siege and ironically a white mage, sent us to Alduin where we would be safe and eventually, educated."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "In all honesty, I'm surprised they accepted us; we were young, belligerent saplings uprooted from our forest. We longed for home."

        [part]
            story= _ "Elantos never got over our father's death. He would stay up during the long hours of the night, researching to discern if it was possible to restore life to the dead."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "And so it would be his fate that one day, years after we arrived on Alduin's shores, he found exactly what he was looking for. An orcish shaman had come from the north to observe Wesnothian magic as part of an attempted treaty between a few of the tribes and the Empire. He brought with him an ancient tome written by Mal Arkal-Thil; a necromancer that had terrorized the orcish north, but was eventually defeated by the Lady of Light. Elantos convinced the shaman to sell it to him, and he engrossed himself in its study immediately."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "I, being the good brother, told no one. But the headmasters found out anyway. Elantos fled the isle, and the orcish shaman was killed by the enraged magi."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "And so it was for many years that my brother and I had no contact: He lurked upon the edges of Wesnoth with skeletons while I learned how to command fire. After twelve years at Alduin, I was sent to Weldyn, to continue my studies there. Vikren XII and I spoke often during those days, but it wasn't but a couple of years before he died."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "Vikren XIII was more reserved than his father, but a likeable emperor nonetheless. My mentor and Archmagi council member, Taltorth, was his personal advisor, so we met early-on due to my position as an assistant. Taltorth was anything but the new Emperor's favorite, however. They were in constant discord - court rulings, appointees, everything. Taltorth insisted on traditional imperial views while Vikren argued for a more unconventional society."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "Four years into Vikren XIII's rule, Taltorth fell ill and I was burdened with caring for him. Vikren approached me about a week into the event: if I guaranteed Taltorth's death in a timely manner, his open seat on the Council was mine."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "I am no angel, Devanar. I wanted his position and Taltorth would clearly recover given due time and attention. Vikren needed my help to solidify his vision for a new Wesnoth. And so I decided to guarantee the opposite of Taltorth's expectations for an eventual recovery..."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "All it took was adding small amounts of poison to a placebo solution I had been telling him was his medicine. And soon after Taltorth's passing, Vikren honored his word."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "And for a little over three decades we brought much change to the Empire. Vikren passed several imperial decrees bringing new reforms. Diplomatic relations were reopened with the Dunefolk of the Sandy Wastes. Wesnoth established cities on the Three Sisters and southern holdings were solidified. The Wesnothian Drafts were written, a series of documents outlining specific rights for citizens of the Empire. And over that time we grew close, Vikren and I. Perhaps out of like-mindedness or out of necessity due to our conspiracy, I became one of his most trusted persons."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "In my opinion it was perhaps the best time period Wesnoth had enjoyed since the Garardine dynasty."
