Every child in Parandel grew up hearing stories of the most powerful lords and spellbinders of their day, as well as tales of the two ever-present members: Mal Idyr and Mal N'tos. Necromancy had generally grown to be accepted as less of a monstrosity and more of a necessity, as the years flew past. I myself understand liches can be terrible beings but... After all they have done for the survivors of this cataclysm, with seemingly no benefit to themselves, I should like to believe that the two that guide us all are different."

Therefore, Erya said that she, as the new Demon Lord of her peoples, would go there and find the Rod, but that she would use something called the 'Soul Jewel of Tirasz' to find it. After that, she discovered my listening, barging into the room where I hid, and so I channeled all my energy into a single spell of teleportation, and at Ortraxz I awoke."
