            story= _ "It had been a long while since I had last been to Amurlai - I went there once on a trip with Chamilix. In build, it was hardly different from most cities in Parandel: tall towers weathered by the desert wind and caked with sand, nearly blending into the landscape around them. But as we walked through the gates, the signs of siege presented themselves all over the city: craters, crumbling structures, obliterated walls, rubble strewn about in the streets, weary-worn faces and bowed heads... We are hardly the grand people we once thought ourselves to be, that is for sure. At least, in appearance, that is."

The spell left a rather large crater, and those of Erya's soldiers who weren't swallowed up by the sands or buried alive by the shifting dunes were flung back by shockwaves. Alazarik was a traitor - a shapeshifter planted by Erya, who struck inside First Keep when the time was nigh.
