In spite of, or perhaps because of Erya's destruction and recreation of his original self, Aegis is incredibly powerful. His adept knowledge of elemental summoning, necromancy, and arcane battle magic make him a fierce foe by any standards. His biomechanical body makes him better equipped to handle certain types of attacks, although it makes him more vulnerable to others. The physical weapons Aegis wields are just as dangerous as his magical power - granting him the power to drain his enemies' life force or even raise them again into undeath. His conviction in his cause and intense hatred will make this a hard fight. Be wary of his minions and any tricks he may attempt. Good luck, brave hero. You'll need it to defeat an elite battlemage of the Chaos Empire."
