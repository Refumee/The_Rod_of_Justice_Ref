            story= _ "Adria and Mal Idyr have softened a little bit since their argument - at the very least the air of confrontation has somewhat dissipated. They both seem friendlier, come to think of it... It is as Chamilix advised; they would slowly grow to respect me. Or, perhaps I have simply worn them down to the point that they find silence futile. I will accept the result in either case."

            story= _ "We have now journeyed further into Firecloud Peak, far from the entrance the Sentinels guarded. It is evident that drakes used to live here, the stonework could only be that of a great clawed beast. The dark tunnels echo with naught but our shambling footsteps and the rumbles of the mountain - though it seems that, finally, I am no longer the only one who cannot stand the silence. In the haunting quiet, Mal Idyr has taken to telling our company of soldiers stories from the days of Wesnoth once more, returning to the final chapter of his days as an archmage:"

She and I became my brother's apprentices soon after; we needed a means to an end, a way to once again wield power amidst our disgrace, and necromancy was the available option to utilize in the Guild's destruction.'"

As we were licking our wounds in the Bitter Swamp, Dantair grew paranoid despite his reputation as a pious nobleman with the backing of the Guild of White Magi and the new Council of Archmagi. His insecurities, ego, and the public eye eventually pressured him to decree the creation of Gaia, the third sun.'"

Gaia was rushed into creation by far too few sorcerers, and the results were cataclysmic when they attempted to raise it. The aftermath you now call 'The Fall'. Many of the saurians died in the years after; volcanic eruptions lead to poisonous air that killed off most of the swamp. To survive, we dug deep into the depths of the Estmarks in search of sanctuary from the hellscape outside. Eventually, we found a natural cave system that proved stable amidst the relentless earthquakes in surrounding regions.'"

He told us to travel north when the time was right, and establish a city where the capital of the Lintanir forest elves was. We knew not where such a place lied, and on further prompting for directions Tirasz only stated that the spirit of the ancient elvish lady Parandra would guide us.'"

As others moved on during the long time we hid underneath those hills, Elantos pooled their souls, life force, and magical energy. Eventually it became a sort of library- with the minds of saurian generations able to speak with their children, and lend them power should they need it.'"

About a century and a half after the Fall, we'll never be sure because of all the damned darkness and debris, we departed our shelter in the Estmarks. Danica and I had since aged and transitioned into lichdom, the last magi in a world ravaged by magic. She stayed behind in the caves with a splinter group of saurians and wrote on scrolls the stories of the three of us: Mal N'tos, Mal Idyr, and Mal Ni-cai. I do not know if she still exists, but assuming Erya's current awareness, she has likely been captured or defeated.'"

Through undead labor it was established quickly and fashioned in a glorious design. As the saurian population grew, we sent groups of them to the southwest and southeast to build Tiraszshold and Krextin. Amurlai was built primarily by ogres and humans decades after that. Stray humans arrived after a while, then ogres, then Aragwaithi fleeing the War of Consolidation, and most recently, we arrived at peace terms with the self-proclaimed Bandit Queen, Raelyan, who brought more humans to New Elensia and the surrounding lands.'"

That was how I so heavily wounded Erya on the battlefield; I tapped into the Soul Jewel.'"
