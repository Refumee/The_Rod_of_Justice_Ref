            story= _ "With our soldiers now returned to us, we followed Vikren through series of winding tunnels that we would have otherwise been trapped in for eternity. It's possible to see all the different types: the carved stonework tunnels of the drakes, the accidental pathways left by magma, jagged burrows carved out by Arachne and her creatures. At times, when Vikren floats on, wandering ahead of the rest of us, Mal Idyr will shamble up to him, and the two will trade a few short strings of words before one hangs back or the other rushes ahead. I can only wonder what they discuss, but it seems to be the same conversation, repeated over and over, as if the lich lord expects a different result should he try hard enough."

            story= _ "They both exude a great deal of magic - I do not believe I would be as attentive of that if I didn't hold the Rod. Now, with the Rod of Justice in my hand... Everything feels astonishingly clear. I can see better, I feel swift of foot, and despite whatever playful murmurs my soldiers voice within earshot about the glances Adria and I exchange from time to time, I still find myself always keeping a level head. To be honest, I... I do not fully know what she makes of me, nor truly I of her. But I do know that I am delighted by her company. Maybe, once this quest is complete... I shall have the chance to get to know her in less dire circumstances."

            story= _ "Every now and then, I glimpse slivers of the Adria that I imagine was more present before all this business with Erya: a slight curl of a smile, a gentle laugh, a curious gaze that washes over the stones around us, a teasing remark that somehow sounds caring as it is barbed. I imagine that when she lived on Shimmering Isle... She must've been much different. Though the same could be said of me at my outpost. And of Mal Idyr before the Fall. I fear that this crisis is chipping away the softer parts of us, such that little will remain of our former selves at its end."

            story= _ "Regardless of all my personal matters, though, I keep sensing that there's something deep within this artifact... A stored power that no one has yet unlocked. I don't have time to dwell over all of its capabilities, but so far it has allowed me to wield lighting and coldness somewhat separately, instead of only controlling them as one merged spell. With enough help from the Order, I think it could easily teleport New Elensia, and possibly Amurlai, too."

        [part]
            story= _ "I still wish we could battle on and fight to reclaim Krextin and Tiraszshold. I know it would be a hopeless endeavor, but it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to run, though I know it to be the sensible thing. And yet, I am deeply saddened. If the teleportation is successful, there will be practically no trace of Parandel's mark on the desert but ruins and craters. And with time, the sands will swallow those, and then even the earth will forget us. Yet another cheerful musing from me, of course... But it remains a thought I cannot shake. If there is no one to remember us but the armies of the invaders, then it is as if we were never here at all. Like we were just erased. Is that not haunting? Is that not worth mourning?"

        [part]
            story= _ "Alas, perhaps I think too much. I should focus. We must make haste - Erya likely hasn't been idle all this time, and I cannot allow Parandel to fall because we were too slow."

He could not cry, because what was left of his eyes were merely glowing sockets of light. But Devanar and the others could tell that if he had tears, they would be streaming from his eyes. No one moved. The only sound in the chamber was the quiet drip of cave water and the soft rising and falling of chests, the soldiers no longer engaged in battle. After a while, Mal Idyr opened his skeletal jaws, and out of it poured the most frightening, inconsolable, and inhuman wail any of them had ever heard."
