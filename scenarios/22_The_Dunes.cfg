Some nights during our journey, when most of our soldiers have fallen asleep, and only the dead and a few sentries linger about our camp, I gaze out at the hills and ponder my mistakes. It is those nights - the ones so quiet it feels as if all the world is holding its breath - that I feel an urge to sink into my worst despairs. That I wonder if we perhaps should have surrendered to Erya - that if more of our people might still be alive then. That a voice whispers to me that I am to to blame for so many deaths."

The rest of our company and I have whipped ourselves into a frenzy ever since the skirmish at the oasis - partially because of Raourshin's gliders telling us that Erya's host is not far behind us, and partially because we all hope that we may find the city we once left still whole. Maybe, if we all survive this gruesome ordeal... There will be room and time to rebuild a kinder world."
