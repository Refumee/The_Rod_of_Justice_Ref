            story= _ "Mal Idyr has been near silent since our battle with Vikren. He's doing his best to be stoic, yet... I think he's still grieving. I do not think I've ever seen him go so long without a word to any of us; there has not even been a barbed remark or complaint or veiled insult - just stillness. I truly cannot fathom his pain. And yet, when I think of all that he told us... He was lucky to know such happiness in life. I imagine there are many that never come to know it."

        [part]
            story= _ "I do wonder, what exactly, a lich has to live for - eventually all those you once knew pass, and you are left to spend the ages with yourself and little else. The pursuit of knowledge, I suppose, or maybe power - but I imagine that at some point the price paid exceeds that of the gift it bought. Ultimately, though, at least Mal Idyr has his brother. Most necromancers resign themselves to an eternity alone, but an eternity spent with a friend must not be so tormenting. And Parandel itself is a kind of friend to him as well. Perhaps that is what gives you purpose, then. Perhaps, even when that dearest to you is taken, you may yet make a home out of something else in its place."

        [part]
            story= _ "On a lighter note, I've spent much of my time navigating the tunnels with Adria, and it has gone quite well. She has formally introduced me to Raourshin Ohn, her old drake friend from Shimmering Isle. He seems to be a jolly creature, but the climate and nature of his arrival have quieted much of that. He tells me that he thinks I have a strong 'inner fire,' which I suppose is a sign of approval and a compliment among drakes."

        [part]
            story= _ "Raourshin told us he'd been given a map of Ignis' old tunnels by his queen - and it is with those that we now continue to guide ourselves to the surface with. Now that I look around at my soldiers, my friends... I think perhaps attachment is not the worst thing. Each person I care for is like a small light. Together, they create a glow to make these dark times bearable. I think even Mal Idyr's arrogance hides an unspoken kind of care for the rest of us, though he would never admit it."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "I can only hope that they are not extinguished by Erya. Although, I suppose, she may not be the grand architect of our misfortune. There seems to be two significant figures that everyone references - Uria, and the Emperor of Chaos. I know not who either of them are, where they came from, or how we shall defeat them... Or if we can defeat them at all."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "I've been contemplating Chamilix's advice. For knowing when to sheathe my sword and when to wield it. I believe we should flee, and I do not mean that lightly or with an ounce of cowardice."
        [/part]
        
        [part]
            story= _ "Perhaps, we can find Erya and Edangor, and maybe even triumph against them. But these other two seem too mighty and too mysterious to stop. I can only hope that as we flee, they do not follow us. Still, although I know this escape to be valid by reason and thought... I hold a fear deep within my heart. What if these two masterminds continue their rampage? We were a nation of four old cities and strong armies made up of a variety of soldiers. And here we are, fleeing somewhere else. I cannot help but feel that in our flight, we will doom others, different survivors from different places, yet people all the same, to similar fates..."

            story= _ "I wish I could tell them that we are so, so, sorry. I wish I could tell them that we tried our best. That we stood up to the forces of chaos and battled with them, that our best and brightest went toe-to-toe with demons and mechanical creatures and men clad in gilded armor. But I don't suppose it will really matter to them. Because our best was bested. Because our brightest hopes were, simply, not enough. And because they will be slaughtered before they ever know how awful I feel."
