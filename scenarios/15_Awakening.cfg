The Order worships fire and light, and a nameless goddess of flames whose name has been lost to time. Nevertheless, the Order's priests and priestesses search for it relentlessly. Each generation is led by a High Priest or Priestess, who absorbs and carries within them the Heartflame: an enchanted orb-like organ of wondrous fire magic, said to have been given to the first acolytes of the Order centuries ago by a dying Armageddon Drake. With it, one may summon spirits of the Holy Flame, create raging tempests of fire, and rejuvenate those around them. The current bearer of the Heartflame is High Priestess Valgatha of House Esari, daughter of Meressa."

The most renowed premonition, retold in every household, is of Tirasz's vision of the ancient Lintanir Elf Lady Parandra, who appeared to him numerous times, guiding him, the lich brothers, and his band of surviving saurians to the buried ruins of the old Lintanir capital Elensia. Why an elvish mystic elected to guide a saurian oracle to the heart of former elvish civilization remains unclear - though Tirasz did emphasize that the 'blood of Synia' was amongst them, and Parandra sought to protect that at all costs. Some augurs assert that it is the Lintanir elves' atonement for the ancient destruction of Saurgrath, others allege that one of the lich brothers must've had a distant elvish ancestor that linked Parandra to them, while others cite her legacy of generosity towards. Regardless, the information was sound, and the lingering vegetation and small, ebbing river nestled amidst the old ruins was enough to form the first foothold of the group of settlements later christened 'Parandel.'"

Among the most notable of recorded explorations within this volume is Mal N'Tos' journey across the sands to investigate the insides of local mountain ranges. Underground, he discovered a species of giant cave leeches, which, with sufficient effort, could be domesticated, or perhaps even be used as mounts for saurian soldiers. Though their extraction to and residence in Parandel has since brought many unease, they are utterly loyal creatures that have swelled the ranks of Parandel's military. Usually, they are cared for by saurians and humans of Wesnothian descent. Any aspiring leech tamer should note that, although deathly loyal once domesticated, doing so is no easy task - they are brutal companions who will be ever thirsty for blood. Keeping them well-fed is strongly recommended. Naturally, they prey on bats and lesser spiders - outside the caves, their appetites are less well-documented, though they have been known to prey on humans."

Not only can magical energy be stored and accessed more easily in it, but it is a popular place for fledgling augurs to practice their water, ice, and mud-based curses. At the center sits a beautiful garden that flourishes despite the lack of sunlight. It is here that many of Parandel's barrier-generating crystals are charged, and Tiraszshold's own protective crystal is usually rooted within the Nexus' center as well."

Formerly a proud house for much of Wesnoth's history, they began falling out of favor with the rest of the kingdom's noble houses during the reign of Queen Asheviere. Over time, their expansive family dwindled down to to a few branches, and then to just one line. Notable members include Lord Helicrom, a powerful shadow mage whose legendary blade became a powerful magical artifact and heirloom, as well as the house's last heirs: brothers Elantos and Elidyr who eventually turned to necromancy. Historically, House Amithren and their ancestral seat in the Grey Woods were known for their magical talent across several fields of sorcery, tendency to take in displaced peasants and nomads, and occasional alliances with splinter factions of elves."

It details a history of his clan's struggle for survival, from their arrival in Irdya to their forced service to Erya to their infiltration of Parandel. While he longs for peace, the author ultimately laments that he will have to become a tool of violence in order for his fellow shapeshifters to survive - though he notes that some of his kind have successfully blended into Parandel's civilian population, and hopes that they may escape Erya's control this way and achieve some semblance of a calmer life."

Some citizens speak of an hidden power stored in the old elvish bricks, that even the most powerful sorcerers in Parandel have failed to unlock, but most dismiss this as hearsay or an urban legend. Regardless of its mysterious and storied past, First Keep remains an iconic fixture in New Elensia, and is where the Convocation convenes to discuss matters of state."

As such, the Ironmen are master craftsmen and weaponsmasters, yet many of them hoard their creations - most other military forces are limited to spears, axes, and sometimes swords to conserve metal. Though their armor is often impractical in this new and burning Wesnoth, they continue to craft hulking suits of steel and iron, and hold strong influences in the day-to-day workings of New Elensia and Amurlai."

Descended from a small Wesnothian town known for its hulking warriors, blacksmithing talent, strict customs, and unbreakable unity, the Ironmen eventually left the ruins of Wesnoth and settled southeast of New Elensia. Though they were eventually absorbed as part of Parandel, they retain near-exclusive control over many of the nation's ore reserves. Recently, an alliance was forged between the Aragwaithi and the Ironmen when High Priestess Valgatha wed Lord Loreimir, giving the Aragwaithi expanded access and control over Parandel's metal deposits and weapon smithing."

As more wandering bands of survivors gradually submitted to Parandel's increasing geographic dominance, Amurlai was constructed to guard the northernmost border of Parandel against bandit attacks. It is the youngest of Parandel's four major cities, and is built around an oasis that Prince Thochor once rested at during his journey south. Its walls are virtually impenetrable - the city was constructed in a series of four rings of walls, with their strength increasing the further in one travels. Historically, many of the noble Aragwaithi houses of Parandel have resided in Amurlai."
